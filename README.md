Every biology fan knows that the mechanisms behind a gene's transcription setting and regulation are quite complex. A factor that seemed interesting to me was the affinity between the DNA Binding Domain (DBD) of a transcription factor and the DNA promoter sequence of a gene. So, I decided to find a way to investigate it myself.
After a lot of thought, I looked into TP53 as a transcription factor and how different genes were expressed according to the DBD-promoter affinities.
